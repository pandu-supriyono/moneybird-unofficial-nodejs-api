# Moneybird Unofficial Node.js API

Unofficial type-safe Node.js wrapper around the official [Moneybird REST API](https://developer.moneybird.com).

## Expression of intent

For a side project, I wanted a type-safe way to make API calls to the Moneybird API and minimize run-time errors.
To this end, I decided to borrow techniques from functional programming and specifically
the [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/) and [io-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/io-ts/) libraries.
